    <p class="content">The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated
        species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild
        members of the family. A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely
        and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt
        rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries</p>

    <p class="content">The domestic dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. The
        dog derived from an ancient, extinct wolf,and the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest living
        relative.The dog was the first species to be domesticated,by hunter–gatherers over 15,000 years
        ago,before the development of agriculture. long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely
        adapted to human behavior,leading to a large number of domestic individualsand the ability to thrive on
        a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.</p>
